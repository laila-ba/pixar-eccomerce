                <h5 class="text">Miguel is a 12-year-old who struggles against his family’s generations-old ban on
                    music. “Miguel secretly nurtures this love of music,” says director Lee Unkrich. “He’s constructed a
                    guitar and designed it to mimic Ernesto’s iconic skull guitar. And he’s taught himself to play.”

                <h5 class="text">Héctor, a charming trickster in the Land of the Dead, enlists Miguel’s help to visit the Land of the Living. “He desperately wants to cross the marigold bridge on Día de los Muertos,” says co-director Adrian Molina. “But there's a rule that if no one in the Land of the Living is actively remembering you—if no one has put your photo up on an Ofrenda—then there's no one in the Land of the Living to receive you and you cannot cross over.”

                <h5 class="text">Dante is a Xolo dog—short for Xoloitzcuintli—the national dog of Mexico. Nearly hairless, Dante has trouble keeping his tongue in his mouth due to his missing teeth—but he’s a loyal companion to Miguel. “Dante is Miguel’s confidant, the only character he shares his music with,” says screenwriter Matthew Aldrich.

                <h5 class="text">Miguel’s idol Ernesto de la Cruz, is the most famous musician in the history of Mexico. Revered by fans worldwide until his untimely death, the charming and charismatic musician is even more beloved in the Land of the Dead. “Ernesto de la Cruz’s catchphrase was ‘Seize your moment,’” says director Lee Unkrich. “And Miguel takes that to heart.”

                    To support Miguel’s adoration of Ernesto, filmmakers realized they would need to build the career of the fictional performer. Co-director Adrian Molina teamed up with songwriter/composer Germaine Franco to write some of the songs in Ernesto’s repertoire. “Music is important to Miguel and it anchors Ernesto’s character,” says Molina. “So we wanted to write a few songs that would demonstrate the kind of performer that Ernesto was and maybe show what makes him so popular.”

                <h5 class="text">Abuelita is Miguel’s grandmother and the ultimate enforcer of the Rivera family rules. She loves her family very much and will do anything to protect them. But when she gets angry, she wields a mean shoe. “Abuelita is the torchbearer when it comes to the family’s rule where music is concerned,” says director Lee Unkrich. “She can be warm and loving one moment and sharp-tongued and strict the next. That’s what’s so entertaining about her—you never know what you’re going to get.”

                <h5 class="text">Frida, a ground breaking artistic figure in Mexican culture, continues her expressive vision in the Land Of The Dead and is one of Miguel’s first artistic allies, helping him to see that a life of an artist could actually be more than just a dream.
