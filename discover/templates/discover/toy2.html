        <h5 class="text text-center"> Buzz, Woody, and their friends are back as Andy heads off to Cowboy Camp, leaving his toys to their own devices.  Things shift into high gear when an obsessive toy collector name Al McWhiggin, owner of Al's Toy Barn, kidnaps Woody.  At Al's apartment, Woody discovers that he is a highly valued collectible from a 1950s TV show called "Woody's Roundup."  He meets the other prized toys from the show:  Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye the Horse, and Stinky Pete the Prospector.  Andy's toys mount a daring rescue mission, Buzz Lightyear meets his match, and Woody has to decide where he and his heart truly belong.
