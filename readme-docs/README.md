## The Strategy Plane

Pixar's film taget audience are very wide as its a universal studio that everyone loves, and therefore doesnt have a niche, specific audience. I wanted to project this through my site so that a large demograpic can easily access the webiste without any difficulty.


### Target Audeince for My Pixar Site :
    - Age: 15-44 as the films are loved by almost everyone including children, young adults and seniors.
    - Users who are big fans of all/specific films.
    - Users who need information on characters or film trailers.
    - Users who are comfortable and are able to use a device connected to the internet
    - Users who want to buy Pixar toys, clothes and objects.
