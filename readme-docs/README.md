# User Experience (UX)
## The Strategy Plane

Pixar's film taget audience are very wide as its a universal studio that everyone loves, and therefore doesnt have a niche, specific audience. I wanted to project this through my site so that a large demograpic can easily access the webiste without any difficulty.


### Target Audeince for My Pixar Site :
    - Age: 15-44 as the films are loved by almost everyone including children, teenagers and adults.
    - Users who are big fans of Pixar films.
    - Users who need information on characters or film trailers.
    - Users who are able to use a device connected to the internet
    - Users who want to purchase Pixar toys, clothes and merchandise.
        
### Features:

As part of the planning process for the strategy plane, i find it helpful to plan out which features are of most importance to include in the project on a small scale of 1-3 (3 being the most important.) By doing this technique, i am able to focus more on the higher ranked features and work my way down the table.
